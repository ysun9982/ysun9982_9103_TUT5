## Artworks: Anwar Jalal Shemza 'Apple Tree'
Our group chose Anwar Jalal Shemza's 'Apple Tree' to reproduce and recreate. We retained the overall layout and structure of the painting, abstracted and flattened the artwork, and preserved its main features while altering and adding details.

## Time-Based: Employ timers and events for animation.
I created a loop animation that simulates the entire day an apple tree goes through, including the four stages of day, dusk, night, and dawn.
