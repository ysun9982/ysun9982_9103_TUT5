### Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I plan to represent Piet Mondrian's artwork. And the imaging technique I'd like to use is to give a three-dimensional dimension to the flat two-dimensional abstract painting. Because stereoscopic vision involves creating depth and a three-dimensional effect in images. My inspiration comes from the Paris Olympics teaser video, which features interesting drone footage of urban traversal. I intend to use this approach to transform the original artwork's long lines into city roads, the large squares into building blocks, and the small squares into representations of vehicles moving through the city.
